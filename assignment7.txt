/*Rebecca Hale Assignment 7 Part 2*/
1. ++*p increments the value that the pointer is pointing at by one. *p++ 
does not change the value of any variable but increments where the pointer
is pointing at by one, so it goes to the next memory location. *++p 
increments the memory location of the pointer by one.

2. char *p = (char *)0; /*creates a null pointer*/
   int *p = NULL; /*creates a null pointer*/
A null pointer can be assigned to any pointer type and is defined as a
pointer that does not "point" to any specific address, it essentially
points to nothing.

3. Null pointers are often used to signify the end of a program and they
are also used to figure out when a certain action has failed to occur.

4. Pointers can be added and subtracted.  Often times, pointers are added
and subtracted in order to access memory locations adjacent to the pointer,
specifically in arrays and strings.  For instance, if a pointer array was
created (int *arr) and the third location in the array needed to be accessed, arithmetic could be used to obtain whatever integer was in the third 
location of the array *(arr+3).

5. int* arr1[8]; - creates an array of size 8 full of integer pointers
   int (*arr2)[8]; - creates a pointer to an array of 8 ints
   int *(arr3[8]); - same as the first example, creates an array of size 8
   		     full of pointer integers
