1. What is the difference between ++*p, *p++, and *++p?
	++*p increments value at location 'p', then stores it in the in the incremented value.
	*p++ advances p from the location p points to
	*++p also advances p from the location p points to

2. How would the NULL pointer be represented in terms of its data type and value? Your answer should be in a format such as (int) 3 or (char) c.
	The value of a NULL pointer is 0, and it does not havea data type. You would represent it as NULL (0).
	
3. What are use cases for NULL pointers?
	When you want to represent conditions, such as at the end of a list with an unknown length, or when you aren't able to perform some action.

4. Can you subtract or add pointers? Why would you?
	You can only subtract pointers, when you want to move around to different places in the array, or to see how far apart the two integers are. 

5. What is the difference between the following declarations?
	int* arr1[8] and int *(arr2)[8] are the same, both arrays of 8 pointers to integers. int *(arr3[8]) points to an array of 8 integers.
