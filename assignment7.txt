1)
	1. ++*p - increments value at the location that p points to, then evaluates p.
	2. *p++ - evaluates the value at location p, then advances p.
	3. *++p - advances p, then evalutates the value at location p
2) A NULL pointer is a pointer that represents an area of memory with no value. an example of a null pointer would be int *p = NULL;.
3) A NULL pointer is used to know if you reached the end of a list when you don't know the length.
4)  You can add and subtract pointers. This can be used to find different values within an array.
5)
	1)Creates an array of 8 pointers which are integers.
	2) Points to an array of size 8.
	3) Same as the first one.
