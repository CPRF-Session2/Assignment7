1. ++*p increments the value of the location p is pointing to by one, and then stores the value

*p++ advances the location the pointer is pointing by 1

*++p increments that value the pointer is pointing to by 1

2. NULL pointer: int *p;

3. NULL pointers can be used to repersent the end of a list

4. You can subtract and add pointers, this could be used to advance through arrays using pointers, and then change the values in an array at those indexes.

5. int* arr1[8] is an array of 8 integer pointers

int (*arr2)[8] is a pointer, pointing to 8 arrays of integers
int (*arr3[8]) is an array of 8 integer pointers
