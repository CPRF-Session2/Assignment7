1.)      /*Armstrong Park, this is my homework*/
	++*p adds one to the value that pointer p is pointing to
	*p++ goes to the next index in the array you are reffering to 
	*++p is the same as *p++

2.)
	Since it is NULL the data type doesn't matter. An example of how you could write it is *var = NULL

3.)
	All I know is that a NULL pointer points to nothing, but I don't know when that would be useful.

4.)
	You can and you would use them to navigate through a specific array.

5.)
	The first one creates 8 pointers that point to integers.
	
	A pointer to an array of integers

	The third one is the same as the first one
