1. Explain the difference between ++*p, *p++ and *++p.
	++*p incrementes the value that the pointer points to
	*p++ evaluatates the value that p points to, then adds one to p so it evaluates the next location 
	*++p increments *p so that it evaluates the next number in the set

2. How would the NULL pointer be represented in terms of its data type and value? Your answer should be in a format such as (int) 3 or (char) c. Please also include an explanation.
	char *c=0; 
		This creates a pointer that points nowhere because the memory location is 0.

4. What are use cases for NULL pointers?
	When you want to check if a pointer has a location in it. You could write: 
		int *p
		int* null=0;
		if (*p==*null) {p is null}
5. Can you subtract pointers? Can you add them? Why would you?
	Yes, to advance or move back where the pointer pointed to. You can change the memory location.

6. What is the difference between the following declarations:
	
	They all create an array of pointers.
